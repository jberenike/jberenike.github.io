# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland). 
From March 2011 until August 2017, I worked as a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University and as a postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’. 
I studied German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Göttingen and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 
Before assuming a position as a PhD student and lecturer at VU University Amsterdam, I  was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology. 
I conducted my doctoral thesis on ‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’.

My research interests focus on corpus sytlistics, literary modernism, discourse and text processing, and metaphor studies.
