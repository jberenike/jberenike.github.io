### Welcome to my webpage!

**I am professor of Newer German Literature with a specialization in Literary Theory and Digital Humanities** at the [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/linguistik-literaturwissenschaft/studium-lehre/faecher/germanistik/aktuelles.xml) and PI at Bielefeld University’s Collaborative Research Centre ‘Practices of comparing: ordering and changing the world’ [(SFB 1288)](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/sfb/sfb1288/). I am also appointed Private Lecturer in Digital Humanities and Newer German Literature at [Basel University](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/de/personen/berenike-herrmann/), and an associate member of the [Herman-Paul-School Graduate of Linguistics](https://www.hpsl-linguistics.org/people/faculty-and-researchers/) in Freiburg i. Br., D/Basel, CH. My offices include being Speaker of the [Community of Practice "Digital Literacy" of BiLinked](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/themen/bilinked/communities-of-practice/data-literacy/) at Bielefeld University, being current chair of the international ADHO Special Interest Group "Digital Literary Stylistics" [SIG DLS](https://dls.hypotheses.org), and SIG Liaison at [ADHO's COB](https://adho.org/administration/steering). Until its finalization in May 2022, I was Management Committee member of the "[COST Action Distant Reading](https://www.distant-reading.net/) for European Literary History". In the fall semester 2020/2021, I was visiting professor of Digital Humanities at the Excellence Cluster ["Temporal Communities"](https://www.temporal-communities.de/) at FU Berlin.

**As a Digital Humanist**, I strive to understand the potential as well as the constraints of the digital transformation of (global) societies and the Humanities. When addressing one of the big topics of our times, **Artifical Intelligence (AI)** I find it important to note that "AI" carries strong connotations, and is thus prone to be misunderstood. I see it as one of my tasks to demystify the term, by a thorough view on what AI really means at a technical level for particular tasks (by contrast to ideas of AI in Science Fiction). For the field of DH, a descriptive account of AI, lest an encompassing theory of AI, has not yet been put forward, and is thus needed: At this point, AI in DH is clearly limited to types of "Artificial Narrow Intelligence" (ANI), for example when we use ML to build automatic part-of-speech-taggers, to create word-embeddings for semantic analysis, or when training systems to identify authorial style, emotion, or evaluative language. More radically yet, we might even count frequency analyses (as in word clouds or KWICs) as a type of DH-specific "AI". Regardless of their degree of complexity, any of those applications is far from being able to model the type of general human intelligence ("Artifical General Intelligence", AGI) that is applied by scholars in hermeneutics, close textual analysis, or cultural critique. AI in DH is today a growing set of ANI techniques, some very simple, some more complex, and some so complex they become opaque. These techniques have demonstrated the potential to enhance and complement human explanatation and understanding of culture. I am adament that the DH community shall work on furthering that potential while showcasing economically independent and critical AI research.

**In my research**, with my team at Bielefeld, and in other collaborations, I focus on the *digital modeling of literary discourse*. To this end, we adapt methods from Data Science, NLP, and Corpus Linguistics, often using Machine Learning, but also hermeneutic and historiographic analyses: mixed methods. We draw on models from Literary Historiography, Discourse Analysis, (Neo) Structuralism, and Cognitive Stylistics. One building block for our research are corpora, digitally representing literary artefacts. We also apply cognitive stylistics and reader response studies. 

My current main projects are ["Vergleichspraktiken in der Genese, Verstetigung und Transformation von «Nationalliteratur». Der Fall Deutschschweiz"](https://blogs.uni-bielefeld.de/blog/sfb1288/entry/neues_teilprojekt_im_sfb_12881) at the DFG-Collaborative Research Centre (SFB 1288); the SNSF-COST project [Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment](https://mountain-sentiment.github.io/), the SNSF-Digital Lives Project [Forschungslogiken in den texbasierten DH nach dem Machine Learning Turn](http://www.forschungslogiken.net/en/), and the [DFG-SPP "Computional Literary Studies --- CLS"](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/) project ["CHYLSA" --- Children’s and Youth Literature Sentiment Analysis](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/allgpsy/Forschung/Drittmittelprojekte/CHYLSA/index.html). 

**My current main research questions**
- data humanities & data literacy
- the interaction of human and artificial intelligence in the Humanities: usage and implication of mixed methods
- transnational literatury history of German-speaking cultures, using computational methods
- emotion representation in literary texts (historical and systematic)
- spatial mappings in fictional worlds (historical and systematic)
- practices of literary evaluation by users of social reading platforms
- creativity and the style of writers of the 19th and early 20th Centuries (historical and systematic)

I am also keen on finding out more about the effects of reading on well-being.

**Membership in academic societies** I am a member of the Association Digital Humanities im deutschsprachigen Raum ([DHd)](http://dig-hum.de/ueber-dhd), the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations [(ADHO)](http://adho.org/), as well as of the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für allgemeine und vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft [(SGAVL/ASLGC)](https://sagw.ch/sgavl/). Among my affiliations are also the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature & Media [(IGEL)](https://sites.google.com/igelassoc.org/igel2018/home); German Society for Cognitive Linguistics (DGKL), Sektion Computerlinguistik (CL) der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS); and Deutscher Hochschulverband (DHV). 

**Academic bio** I hold a PhD on the topic of metaphor in discourse from VU University Amsterdam (at the prequel of the [Amsterdam Metaphor Lab](http://metaphorlab.org/), for which I received the **Prize for Humanities from the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities** [in 2014](https://adw-goe.de/en/awards/categories/preis-fuer-geisteswissenschaften/preistraeger/). From 2017-2021, I worked as postdoc research associate ("Oberassistentin") at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland), and before that I was postdoc research associate ("wiss. Mitarbeiterin") at the Seminar für Deutsche Philologie at University of Göttingen (Germany) and the [Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities](https://www.gcdh.de/en/campuslab/labs/text/). I obtained my MA (German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature) at the University of Göttingen, studied at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (DAAD Year Stipend), and I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.
