			<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a Digital Humanities generalist, my main field is textual DH, with a PhD from VU University Amsterdam (‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’).</p>
<p>Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland).</p>
			
<p>My favorite textual features are metaphor, morpho-syntactic complexity, and modality. I plead happily guilty of having operationalized the constructs style, narrative vividness, and narrative coherence. We are now working on literary valuation ("Wertung"). My favorite literary epochs (using the term with fuzzy edges) are Modernism, Realism (and how the latter evolves into the prior), and the Early Modern Period (as a period of strong variation as well as the grounds for development of "Newer German Literature"). Currently, I run most of my analyses in R. </p>
<p>In my research, I focus on the digital modeling of literary fictional discourse. One building block for this research are digitally represented literary artefacts that I analyse by means of mixed methods: manual annotation and text mining. My current main research questions are on valuation of literature by users of social reading platforms, the style of writers of the 19th and earlly 20th Centuries, as well as the representation of "nation", "cosmopolitanism", Another building block is the data-driven theoretical modeling of national, transnational, and regional topographies in literary discourse.</p>
<p>To this end, I draw on Literary Historiography, Discourse Analysis, (Neo) Structuralism, and Cognitive Poetics.</p>
<p>Before moving to Basel, I was a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University, and postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’ and the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH). 
After I obtained my MA (German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature) at the University of Göttingen, including a year abroad at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.</p>
