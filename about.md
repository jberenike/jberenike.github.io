### Welcome to my webpage!

**I am professor of Newer German Literature with a specialization in Literary Theory and Digital Humanities** at the [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/linguistik-literaturwissenschaft/studium-lehre/faecher/germanistik/aktuelles.xml) and associate member of Bielefeld University’s Collaborative Research Centre ‘Practices of comparing: ordering and changing the world’ [(SFB 1288)](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/sfb/sfb1288/). I am also appointed Private Lecturer in Digital Humanities and Newer German Literature at [Basel University](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/de/personen/berenike-herrmann/), and an associate member of the [Herman-Paul-School Graduate of Linguistics](https://www.hpsl-linguistics.org/people/faculty-and-researchers/) in Freiburg i. Br., D/Basel, CH. My offices include being Speaker of the [Community of Practice "Digital Literacy" of BiLinked](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/themen/bilinked/communities-of-practice/data-literacy/) at Bielefeld University, being current chair of the international ADHO Special Interest Group "Digital Literary Stylistics" [SIG DLS](https://dls.hypotheses.org), and SIG Liaison at [ADHO's COB](https://adho.org/administration/steering). Until its finalization in May 2022, I was Management Committee member of the "[COST Action Distant Reading](https://www.distant-reading.net/) for European Literary History".

**As a Digital Humanist**, I strive to understand the potential as well as the constraints of the digital transformation of (global) societies and the Humanities. When addressing one of the big topics of our times, *Artifical Intelligence (AI)* I find it important to note that "AI" carries a lot of connotations, and is prone to be misunderstood. I see it as one of my tasks to demystify the term, by a thorough view on what AI really means at a technical level (and thus not in Science Fiction). For the field of DH, a descriptive account of AI, lest an encompassing theory of AI, has not yet been put forward, and is thus needed: At the most basic level, AI in DH is clearly limited to types of "Artificial Narrow Intelligence" (ANI), for example when we use ML to build automatic part-of-speech-taggers, to create word-embeddings for semantic analysis, or when training systems to identify authorial style, emotion, or evaluative language. Such applications are far from being able to model general human intelligence ("Artifical General Intelligence", AGI), as put to use by scholars in hermeneutics, close textual analysis, or cultural critique. AI in DH is today a set of techniques, some simple, some highly complex (and even opaque), that have demonstrated the potential to enhance and complement human academic analysis of culture.

**In my research**, I focus on the *digital modeling of literary discourse*. To this end, I draw on methods from Corpus Linguistics and Data Science, as well as on models from Literary Historiography, Discourse Analysis, (Neo) Structuralism, and Cognitive Stylistics. One building block for my research are corpora, digitally representing literary artefacts, that I analyse by means of mixed methods: manual annotation, hermeneutics, and text mining. I also apply cognitive stylistics and reader response studies. 

In the past few years, my main projects have been the SNSF-COST project [Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment](https://mountain-sentiment.github.io/), the SNSF-Digital Lives Project [Forschungslogiken in den texbasierten DH nach dem Machine Learning Turn](http://www.forschungslogiken.net/en/), and the [DFG-SPP "Computional Literary Studies --- CLS"](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/) project ["CHYLSA" --- Children’s and Youth Literature Sentiment Analysis](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/allgpsy/Forschung/Drittmittelprojekte/CHYLSA/index.html). 

My main field is textual literary DH, with a PhD on metaphor in discourse (VU University Amsterdam) for which I received the Prize for Humanities from the *Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities* [in 2014](https://adw-goe.de/en/awards/categories/preis-fuer-geisteswissenschaften/preistraeger/).
From 2017-2021, I worked as postdoc research associate ("Oberassistentin") at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland), and before that I was postdoc research associate ("wiss. Mitarbeiterin") at the Seminar für Deutsche Philologie at University of Göttingen (Germany) and the [Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities](https://www.gcdh.de/en/campuslab/labs/text/). In the fall semester 2020/2021 I was visiting professor of Digital Humanities at the Excellence Cluster ["Temporal Communities"](https://www.temporal-communities.de/) at FU Berlin.


**My current main research questions**

- practices of literary evaluation by users of social reading platforms
- emotion representation in literary texts (with a focus on Swiss-German Fiction and Fairy Tales)
- spatial mappings in fictional worlds (again with a focus on Swiss-German)
- comparative transnational studies of literatures written in German
- creativity and the style of writers of the 19th and early 20th Centuries ('Realism' and 'Modernism')
- computational measures and methodology.

I am also keen on finding out more about the effects of reading on well-being.


**My favorite textual features** are metaphor, morpho-syntactic complexity, and modality --- approached as "style".

**With regard to style**, that I operationalize as "an ensemble of features" (Herrmann, van Dalen-Oskam, Schöch, 2015) I investigate how holistic descriptions and assessments of literary writing (e.g., *opaque, transparent*, or *vivid*, see Herrmann, 2018a) may be measured by formal discourse features, such as word frequency (Herrmann, 2017), sentence complexity (by readability formula, Herrmann, in print), and part of speech (Herrmann, 2018a), but also metaphor (Herrmann, 2018b, in print; Herrmann, Woll & Dorst, in print) and narrative perspective (Herrmann, Mattner & Lauer, in preparation).  With my colleagues at the SNSF project "Forschungslogiken" we are currently working on describing the style of (e)valuation ("(Be-)Wertung") of books and cooking recipes on the web.

**My favorite literary epochs** (the term with fuzzy edges) are - so far - Realism and Modernism, specifically the transition from one to the other. I have been PI of the [corpus project "KOLIMO"](https://kolimo.uni-goettingen.de/index.html), building a representative comparative corpus of literary Modernism in German, rendered in XML (eXist). 

**In coding, textmining, and statistics** I run most analyses in R, and dabble with python and CWB.

**Membership in academic societies** I am a member of the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für allgemeine und vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft [(SGAVL/ASLGC)](https://sagw.ch/sgavl/), the European Association for Digital Humanities [(EADH)](https://eadh.org/), the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations [(ADHO)](http://adho.org/), as well as of Digital Humanities im deutschsprachigen Raum ([DHd)](http://dig-hum.de/ueber-dhd). My other affiliations are the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature & Media [(IGEL)](https://sites.google.com/igelassoc.org/igel2018/home); German Society for Cognitive Linguistics (DGKL), Sektion Computerlinguistik (CL) der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS); and Deutscher Hochschulverband (DHV). 

**Before moving to Basel**, I was a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University, and postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’ and the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH). Before that I was a PhD candidate at the prequel of the [Amsterdam Metaphor Lab](http://metaphorlab.org/). After I obtained my MA (German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature) at the University of Göttingen, including a year abroad at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.
