I am a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland). 
From March 2011 until August 2017, I worked as a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University and as a postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’. 
I studied German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Göttingen and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 
Before assuming a position as a PhD student and lecturer at VU University Amsterdam, I  was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology. 
I conducted my doctoral thesis on ‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’.

My research interests focus on the empirical study of literature, corpus linguistics, discourse linguistics, psycholinguistics, discourse and text processing, and metaphor studies.
