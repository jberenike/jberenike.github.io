### Symposium “Digital Humanities @IGEL2018”

Symposium at <a href="http://igel2018.no/">Biannual Conference of the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media (IGEL) at Stavanger, Norway</a>,  Stavanger (NO), July 25-28, 2018.

While the digital scholarship symposium at the Chicago IGEL conference 2016 focused on dimensions on “textual analysis”, this year’s convention will cover digital approaches towards "cultural heritage computing". 

It will highlight how digital resources can be utilized for sound empirical research on texts, readers, authors, and contexts. The four contributions will report on trends and methods in digital approaches to literary and cultural artefacts from an array of epochs, languages, genres, and cultures. The range stretches from assessing underlying norms of contemporary Dutch user-based online book reviews (Boot) to the networks underlying Norwegian magazine culture of the 1890s (Furuseth) - from patterns of author similarities based on latent semantic analysis, lexical diversity and sentiment analysis (Jacobs) to the features and dimensions of contemporary novels written in and translated into Dutch (Van Dalen-Oskam). The methods covered are Multimethodological Reader Reception/Evaluation, Surface and Distant Reading for Transnational Periodical Archives, Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA), and Literary Stylometry.

#### Peter Boot: Online reviewers' criteria for judging books
 
The ODBR database of Online Dutch Book Response contains (at the time of writing) 390,000 (short) online book reviews and 510,000 other book response items, harvested from Dutch-language mass review sites and from the largest online bookseller in the Netherlands. While a resource such as this, based on self-selection of participants, can never pretend to be representative of 'the' reader, the database does bring together a very large collection of non-professional writing about literature and books more generally. My paper for the panel will look at the standards about quality in literature and reading that people explicitly or implicitly express in the reviews and other discussions that the database holds.  
Because of the size of the collection, the study of the reviews requires a tool for ‘distant reading’, a tool that can summarize the evaluative aspects discussed in reviews. As an experiment, I am coding a subset of the reviews on the basis of an extended version of the coding system devised by Linders (2012). At the same time, I create rules that assign codes on the basis of linguistic search expressions formulated using the Corpus Query Language (CQL). Comparison of the manual and the derived codes should show whether distant reading the evaluative aspects is a possibility. 



#### Sissel Furuseth: Mapping the Global Networks of Periodicals 

In the twentieth century, the niche of periodical studies was taken care of by a small dedicated group of modernist scholars. During the last fifteen years, however, the field of periodical studies has expanded tremendously, especially at the English departments worldwide, thanks to extensive digitization of magazines and newspapers. The development of digital archives allows for more systematic studies of the rich variety of periodicals, old as well as new ones, small as well as mass-market magazines, giving us access to the past in ways not explored before. For instance, digitization has made it easier to map the underlying infrastructure that connects magazines and writers together in their transnational networks. Thus, scholars are encouraged to combine close reading and surface reading with new techniques of distant reading (cf. Moretti, Cohen, Collier, and others). In my presentation I will address some possible lines of investigation in today’s periodical studies, based on my recent research on the Norwegian magazine culture of the 1890s.


#### Arthur M. Jacobs: The Gutenberg English Poetry Corpus (GEPC): Exemplary Quantitative Narrative Analyses

This paper describes a corpus of about 3,000 English literary texts with about 250 million words extracted from the Gutenberg project
that span a range of genres from both fiction and non-fiction written by more than 130 authors (e.g., Darwin, Dickens, Shakespeare).
Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA) is used to explore a cleaned subcorpus, the Gutenberg English Poetry Corpus (GEPC; Jacobs, 2018)
which comprises over 100 poetic texts with around 2 million words from about 50 authors (e.g., Keats, Joyce, Wordsworth). Some exemplary
QNA studies show author similarities based on latent semantic analysis, significant topics for each author or various text-analytic
metrics for George Eliot’s poem ‘How Lisa Loved the King’ and James Joyce’s ’Chamber Music’, concerning e.g. lexical diversity or
sentiment analysis. The GEPC is particularly suited for research in Digital Humanities, Computational Stylistics, or Neurocognitive
Poetics, e.g. as training and test corpus for stimulus development and control in empirical studies.

#### Karina van Dalen-Oskam: Moving beyond authorship. Literary stylometry
Computational approaches to literary texts are becoming more visible and are drawing more attention than ever. In stylometry, authorship attribution has long been the main focus, but in the last couple of years, stylometry is moving to topics beyond authorship. My contribution will present two examples of stylometry beyond authorship based on my research into Dutch literary works from the past and the present, and in comparison with contemporary translations of fiction into Modern Dutch.

The first example deals with the analysis of character voices. Readers seem to appreciate authors who are able  to create characters that each speak to us in their own, personal voice.  I want to find out if a distinguishable voice of different characters indeed is one of the requirements for a novel to be considered highly literary by its readers. Some years ago, I tried to find a first tentative answer to this question applying stylometric methods to a small corpus of eighteenth-century Dutch epistolary novels. Making use of easily accessible stylometric tools using the bag-of-words approach (a multivariate approach of most frequent words and their frequencies), I found that for these works, only a small group of characters did have a personal, characteristic voice. I also had to conclude that we did not have enough tools yet to answer this question in a convincing empirical way. This led a group of other scholars to apply a much broader set of stylometric measurements to the English epistolary novel Clarissa by Samuel Richardson. I will describe their results and discuss how these may lead to a next step in this research, especially focusing on the problems in dealing with comparing style across language borders.

My first example dealt with historical texts that have made it into the literary canon. Opinions of modern-day readers about these books cannot be seen to be objective – they are prejudiced, being informed by the fact that these books are part of the canon. My second example deals with a corpus of modern novels, many of which certainly are not expected to survive for long and become part of the literary canon in the future. For these books, we can set up experiments asking readers for their opinions, hoping to find why some books are seen to be highly literary whereas others do not deserve such a label for now, and thus to predict which of the titles have the best chances to land in the future literary canon. I will zoom in on one specific phenomenon that I study in the project The Riddle of Literary Quality, namely E.L. James’ trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed, immensely popular novels, marketed in the Netherlands as literary fiction. Contemporary Dutch readers seem to agree that these books surely cannot been seen as having any literary quality at all. Using stylometric tools and methods, I will compare the Dutch translation of the Fifty Shades-trilogy with a corpus of novels marketed as literary fiction, romantic fiction, and suspense. In this present-day example, we can also include the ratings of readers about the literariness of all these books. What does the combination of stylometric measurements and readers’ opinions  show us about conventions of literariness in the minds of Dutch readers? What would the next steps in the research have to be?

These two examples of stylometric analysis may shed more light on what literary texts are and how they are being received by readers, editors and publishers. They yield results that are verifiable and replicable and thus present firmer results than before, leading to new knowledge on which we can build towards even more knowledge.
