			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland), with a PhD from VU University Amsterdam (on ‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’). In my research, I focus on the digital cognitive modeling of literary fictional discourse. One building block for this research are digital data represented in XML-technologies (eXist)[https://kolimo.uni-goettingen.de/index.html] that I analyse by means of manual annotation and text mining, using multi-feature/multi-dimensional statistical analysis (in the sense of Biber). 
				Another building block is the data-driven theoretical modeling drawing on Literary Historiography, Discourse Analysis, Structuralism, and Cognitive Poetics. 
				My favorite textual features are metaphor, morpho-syntactic complexity, and modal particles. 
				Before moving to Basel, I was a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University, and postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’ and the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH). 
				After I obtained my MA (German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature) at the University of Göttingen, including a year abroad at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.
				I am a Management Committee member of the <li><a href="/">COST Action Distant Reading for European Literary History</a></li>
				<li><a href="/">https://www.distant-reading.net/</a></li> and the current chair of the <li><a href="/">ADHO Special Interest Group "Digital Literary Stylistics"</a></li><li><a href="/">https://dls.hypotheses.org/</a></li>.
