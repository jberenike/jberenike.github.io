Welcome! I am a digital humanist that enjoys the analoge! My current position is that of Senior Research and Teaching Associate (“Oberassistentin”) at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland).

In my research, I focus on the digital cognitive modeling of literary fictional discourse. One building block for this research are digital data represented in XML-technologies ( eXist) that I analyse by means of manual annotation and text mining, using multi-feature/multi-dimensional statistical analysis (in the sense of Biber). Another building block is the data-driven theoretical modeling drawing on Literary Historiography, Discourse Analysis, Structuralism, and Cognitive Poetics. My favorite textual features are metaphor, morpho-syntactic complexity, and modal particles.

Before moving to Basel, I was Postdoctoral Research and Teaching Associate (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University, and postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’ and the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH). I obtained my PhD from VU University Amsterdam (PhD thesis on ‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’). After my MA in German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Göttingen and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.
