# about

My research focuses on digital (literary) stylistics, POS and other style markers, literary modernism, discourse processing, and metaphor studies.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the DHLab at the University of Basel (Switzerland), with a PhD from VU University Amsterdam (on ‘Metaphor in Academic Discourse’).

Before I came to Basel, I was a postdoc (‘wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin’) at the Department of German Philology at Göttingen University as well as a postdoctoral member of the Courant Centre ‘Text structures’ and the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH). 
After obtaining my MA (German Language and Literature, Sociology, and Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Göttingen and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) I was a trainee at the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology.
